		<h1>More about Remy</h1>
		<p>
			"Remy’s real home is about a mile from campus, where he lives with his family (including a less adventurous feline brother), but he loves to roam — and when he does, the Harvard campus is his go-to visiting spot, where he has become a much-celebrated unofficial mascot."

		<h1>A few things about cats</h1>
	
		<ul>
			<li>
				Meows are not innate cat language—they developed them to communicate with humans!
			</li>
			<li>
				Domestic cats spend about 70 percent of the day sleeping. And 15 percent of the day grooming.
			</li>
			<li>
				The hearing of the average cat is at least five times keener than that of a human adult.
			</li>
			<li>
				In terms of development, the first year of a cat’s life is equal to the first 15 years of a human life.
			</li>
